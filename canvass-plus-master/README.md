### Adding a new Residence

Adding a new record is quick and efficient. The loading indicator on the Address field signals that your current location is being geolocated. Once the address is auto-filled, you're free to edit it if necessary.

Of course, you can update this record in the future as well.

### Filtering

The table is designed to look simplistic, however it is quite interactive. The search field will apply an intelligent cross-column query filter on each character you type.

Additionaly, you can sort the table by any of the columns.
